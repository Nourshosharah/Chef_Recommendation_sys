Given a list of ingredients, what different recipes can I can make? 
based on what you have ingredients in your home , the system can recommended you best recipes 
here flowchar that the project work on :
![alt text](https://github.com/Nourshosharah/Chef_Recommendation_sys/blob/main/Data/flowchart.PNG)
1.   scraping Data from [jamieoliver](https://www.jamieoliver.com) that has many recipes
2.  then processing Data ingredients that scraped 
3.  extracting Featuers  with TF-IDF 
4. build recommendation sys that use cosine similirity to measure similrity between  ingredients that input from user and ingredients we scraped and exsist in our dataset
5. build flask Api 
6. deployment the project with streamlit
